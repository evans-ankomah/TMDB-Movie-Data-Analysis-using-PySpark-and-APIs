TMDB Movie Data Analysis using PySpark and APIs
Project Overview
This project challenges you to build a movie data analysis pipeline using PySpark and APIs.

You will fetch movie-related data from an API, clean and transform the dataset, and implement key performance indicators (KPIs).

This is not a group project, meaning you will design the workflow, structure the analysis, and implement the required calculations independently.

Project Objectives
API Data Extraction: Fetch movie data from a movie database API.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Process and structure the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an initial exploration to understand trends.

Advanced Filtering & Ranking: Identify the best and worst movies based on financial and popularity metrics.

Franchise & Director Analysis: Assess how franchises and directors perform over time.

Visualization & Insights: Present key findings using visualizations.

Project Steps
Step 1: Fetch Movie Data from API
API_KEY = '33c3009d4610d7c8a3484f3bc865055b'
Choose a movie database API (e.g., TMDb).

Fetch movies with ID:

movie_id = [0, 299534, 19995, 140607, 299536, 597, 135397, 420818, 24428, 168259, 99861, 284054, 12445, 181808, 330457, 3512    86, 109445, 321612, 260513]

Store the data as a PySpark DataFrame.

NB: Read the API documentation to understand the nature of the data and how it's organized.

Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data Preparation & Cleaning
Drop irrelevant columns: ['adult', 'imdb_id', 'original_title', 'video', 'homepage'].

Evaluate JSON-like columns (['belongs_to_collection', 'genres', 'production_countries', 'production_companies', 'spoken_languages']).

Extract and clean key data points:

Collection name (belongs_to_collection)

Genre names (genres → separate multiple genres with "|").

Spoken languages (spoken_languages → separate with "|").

Production countries (production_countries → separate with "|").

Production companies (production_companies → separate with "|").

Inspect extracted columns using value_counts() to identify anomalies.

Handling Missing & Incorrect Data
5. Convert column datatypes:

 'budget', 'id', 'popularity' → Numeric (set invalid values to NaN).
 'release_date' → Convert to datetime.
 etc
6. Replace unrealistic values:

Budget/Revenue/Runtime = 0 → Replace with NaN or infer from similar movies.
Convert 'budget' and 'revenue' to million USD.
Movies with vote_count = 0 → Analyze their vote_average and adjust accordingly.
'overview' and 'tagline' → Replace known placeholders (e.g., 'No Data') with NaN.
7. Remove duplicates and drop rows with unknown 'id' or 'title'.

8. Keep only rows where at least 10 columns have non-NaN values.

9. Filter to include only 'Released' movies, then drop 'status'.

Reorder & Finalize DataFrame

10. Reorder columns:

['id', 'title', 'tagline', 'release_date', 'genres', 'belongs_to_collection', 'original_language', 'budget_musd', 'revenue_musd', 'production_companies', 'production_countries', 'vote_count', 'vote_average', 'popularity', 'runtime', 'overview', 'spoken_languages', 'poster_path', 'cast', 'cast_size', 'director', 'crew_size']

11. Reset index.

Step 3: KPI Implementation & Analysis
Identify the Best/Worst Performing Movies

Filter and rank movies based on:

Highest Revenue

Highest Budget

Highest Profit (Revenue - Budget)

Lowest Profit (Revenue - Budget)

Highest ROI (Revenue / Budget) (only movies with Budget ≥10M)

Lowest ROI (only movies with Budget ≥ 10M)

Most Voted Movies

Highest Rated Movies (only movies with ≥  10 votes)

Lowest Rated Movies (only movies with ≥ 10 votes)

Most Popular Movies

Define a User-Defined Function (UDF) to streamline ranking operations.

Advanced Movie Filtering & Search Queries
2. Filter the dataset for specific queries:

Search 1: Find the best-rated Science Fiction Action movies starring Bruce Willis (sorted by Rating - highest to lowest).
Search 2: Find movies starring Uma Thurman, directed by Quentin Tarantino (sorted by runtime - shortest to longest).
Franchise vs. Standalone Movie Performance

3. Compare movie franchises (belongs_to_collection) vs. standalone movies in terms of:

Mean Revenue
Median ROI
Mean Budget Raised
Mean Popularity
Mean Rating
Most Successful Franchises & Directors

4. Find the Most Successful Movie Franchises based on:

Total number of movies in franchise
Total & Mean Budget
Total & Mean Revenue
Mean Rating
5. Find the Most Successful Directors based on:

Total Number of Movies Directed
Total Revenue
Mean Rating
Step 4: Data Visualization
Use Pandas, Matplotlib to visualize:

Revenue vs. Budget Trends

ROI Distribution by Genre

Popularity vs. Rating

Yearly Trends in Box Office Performance

Comparison of Franchise vs. Standalone Success

Project Deliverables
Complete Workflow: Jupyter Notebook or Python script covering data processing, analysis, and results.

Final Report: Summary of key insights, methodology, and conclusions.

Efficient Code: Clean, modular, and optimized for performance.

Git Best Practices: Proper version control with clear commits and organized structure.
